# Participation of Custodial Institution Staff in Public Human-Rights Activities

## Summary
This document shows the relationship in 2015 between the states with the highest crime prevalence and participation in activities organized by public human-rights bodies, with the aim of later recognizing released individuals’ behavior through time comparisons.

## Context
The Human Rights Organization carries out outreach activities aimed at the protection, defense, promotion, and dissemination of Human Rights to support the development and evaluation of public policies in Mexico.

Effectiveness of training, promotion, and dissemination activities related to Human Rights will be measured based on the participation of staff from custodial institutions in states with high crime prevalence.

When we refer to custodial institutions, we mean persons deprived of their liberty — the incarcerated population and juvenile offenders — compared against the Total Prevalence Rate from the National Survey of Victimization and Perception on Public Security (ENVIPE) by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI).

## Scope and Definitions
- **Custodial Institutions:** persons deprived of liberty and juvenile offenders.
- **Reference Metric:** Total Prevalence Rate from ENVIPE (INEGI, 2015).
- **Effectiveness:** staff participation in human-rights activities.

## Key Findings
Charts are ordered from highest to lowest prevalence. Bars represent general effectiveness (public attendance). Light gray points show staff participation; dark gray points show overall effectiveness.

Audience by state reflects the intentionality behind the promotion of Human Rights. Therefore, a state’s level of prevalence is not necessarily correlated with public participation.

The participation of staff from custodial institutions — light gray points — compared with the effectiveness of general human-rights activities — dark gray points — shows variability in staff participation independently from public attendance, which for most states is similar (between 0 and 250). The main difference lies in the subset that exceeds 500 staff members.

The best way to analyze this behavior is through year-to-year comparisons to identify confidence intervals and conclude whether there is a relationship with reductions in the violence prevalence rate.
